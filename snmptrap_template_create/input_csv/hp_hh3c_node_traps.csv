management interface is changed.  The change maybe originate from NMS,
DHCP server or administrator.
The management interfaces are the interfaces that assigned by
administrator, which can be used to manage device, but may be inactive
for link fault or IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) missing.
The active management interface means an active interface, the IP
address of which can be used for network management.
This notification announces useful management IP address change.  So it
is triggered by significative IP address change.
Suppose that two management interfaces on a device, Interface-A and
Interface-B.  Initially both interfaces are down and assigned no IP
address. Configure Interface-A as the primary monitored interface,
Interface-B as the secondary.
Significative IP address change in following cases:
1. If Interface-A is assigned an IP address primarily, and it is linking
up, then Interface-B will be ignored.  A notification will be triggered,
appending IP address of Interface-A.
