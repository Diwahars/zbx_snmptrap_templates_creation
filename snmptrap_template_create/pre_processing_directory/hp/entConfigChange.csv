of entLastChangeTime changes.  It can be utilized by an NMS
to trigger logical/physical entity table maintenance polls.
An agent should not generate more than one entConfigChange
'notification-event' in a given time interval (five seconds
is the suggested default).  A 'notification-event' is the
transmission of a single trap or inform PDU to a list of
notification destinations.
If additional configuration changes occur within the
throttling period, then notification-events for these
changes should be suppressed by the agent until the current
throttling period expires.  At the end of a throttling
period, one notification-event should be generated if any
configuration changes occurred since the start of the
throttling period.  In such a case, another throttling
period is started right away.
An NMS should periodically check the value of
entLastChangeTime to detect any missed entConfigChange
notification-events, e.g., due to throttling or transmission
loss."
