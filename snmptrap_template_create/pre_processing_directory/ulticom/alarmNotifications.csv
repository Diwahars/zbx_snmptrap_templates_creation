alarmActiveModelPointer has been raised
against the entity indicated by
alarmActiveResourceId.
The agent must throttle the generation of
consecutive alarmActiveState traps so that there is at
least a two-second gap between traps of this
type against the same alarmActiveModelPointer and
alarmActiveResourceId.  When traps are throttled,
they are dropped, not queued for sending at a future time.
A management application should periodically check
the value of alarmActiveLastChanged to detect any
missed alarmActiveState notification-events, e.g.,
due to throttling or transmission loss."
