rttMonReactVar defines the type of reaction that is
configured for the probe ( e.g jitterAvg, rtt etc ).
In the rttMonReactTable there are trap definitions
for the probes and each probe may have more than
one trap definitions for various types ( e.g rtt,
jitterAvg, packetLoossSD etc ). So the object rttMonReactVar
indicates the type ( e.g. rtt, packetLossSD, timeout etc )
for which threshold violation traps has been generated.
The object rttMonEchoAdminLSPSelector will be valid only
for the probes based on 'mplsLspPingAppl' RttMonProtocol. For
all other probes it will be null."
